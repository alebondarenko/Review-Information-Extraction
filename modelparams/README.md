Model Parameters
----------------

For the models trained, we create checkpoints, which get stored here. This helps, in resuming training later from a checkpoint, also, in analysing, when, the model is becoming overfit.

For the results quoted in the paper, the model image can be found here: [Model](https://zenodo.org/record/1415481#.W5pjkBwScnQ). Note that, by default, each model**x** working on data**y**, saves its checkpoints in this directory as: ./model**x**/data**y**. The model image downloaded corresponds to **model3**, **data1**.
